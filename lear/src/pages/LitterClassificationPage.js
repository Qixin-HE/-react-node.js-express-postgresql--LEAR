        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            Our project LEAR stands for Litter Education and Action Resource. This project aims to address the littering issue in four aspects: raising public awareness; providing education regarding littering; deterring the general public from littering and building a platform for environmental volunteers and new volunteers alike to get involved in the effort to clean up our beaches and remove litter from our environment. There are three major groups of people that our project is targeted towards. These are environmental volunteers, litterers and younger children.

            Iteration 1: Open Data Details
    </h3>
        <p>
            In this project we are focusing on using various open data sets. At the current stage, we will be working with 8 datasets, but we will be adding a few more datasets as the project progresses. Not all of these datasets will be utilized during the current iteration, but are being sources in anticipation for future iterations. Datasets for legal information and litter classification will be sources and added to this once located, these are the particular datasets that will be pertinent to iteration 1.
